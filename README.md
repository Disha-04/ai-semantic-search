## What BrainyAI Does

BrainyAI allows users to ask **natural language questions** and receive **context-aware answers** powered by semantic understanding rather than keyword matching.

It works by:
- Converting user queries into **vector embeddings**
- Searching semantically relevant documents using **FAISS**
- Using a **large language model (Groq)** to generate concise answers
- Optionally enhancing answers with **real-time web sources (DuckDuckGo)**

The result is a fast, intelligent Q&A system that explains *why* an answer was returned and, when enabled, shows **supporting sources**.

## What it does
- ✅ ChatGPT-style Q&A for *any* question
- ✅ Optional web lookup (DuckDuckGo) for supporting sources
- ✅ Clean Gemini/Google-like UI
- ✅ Fast responses using **Groq** LLM API
